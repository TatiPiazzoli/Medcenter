                <div class="bio">
                    <div>Matthew was born in Williamstown, in the United States, but was raised in Ottawa, the capital of Canada.
                        His parents divorced when he was less than a year old. 
                        His father was also an actor and as Matthew lived in Canada with his mother who had custody of him,
                        the boy saw television as the only way to see his father.
                    </div>
                    <div>But during his childhood, his fascination with television was overshadowed by his passion for tennis;
                        He was considered a good player and even participated in national championships in Canada,
                        but he realized that he needed more talent to be a professional player. 
                        While his dream of being a tennis player diminished, his passion for the artistic world became greater and greater.
                        Soon Matthew started taking theater courses, first at his school and later at institutes;
                        He always stood out for his tranquility and ease in making others laugh on stage. 
                        Enthusiastic about his dream of being an actor, the young man decided to move to Los Angeles, 
                        where he would have more opportunities and live with his father.
                    </div>
                    <div>At the beginning of his career, he received opportunities in series such as 240-Robert, 
                        Charles in Charge, Silver Spoons and Second Chance. 
                        Bill Richert then gave him the chance to appear in the film A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon, 
                        where he starred opposite River Phoenix.
